X (input):

Audio signal (expert-dictated sentences/phrases)

Extracted features, e.g., MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), spectral properties, i-vectors (for speaker adaptation)

Additionally: domain-specific terms (dictionary, language model)

Y (output):

Text transcription (sequence of words in written form)

Including specialized terminology from the chosen domain (e.g., medical or technical vocabulary)

Simplified:

ðŸ‘‰ X = audio recording (speech signal converted into features)
ðŸ‘‰ Y = recognized text (domain-specific transcription)
